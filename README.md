- 👋 Hi, I’m @astrojuggler
- 👀 I’m a data scientist with a background in astrophysics.
- 🌱 I developed most of my skills around data and image processing, data distributions, modelling with both physical and machine learning models, spectroscopy, Python and Jupyter Notebook.
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborate on projects based on public data, for instance Earth Observations, in particular those related to climate change and sustainability.
- 📫 How to reach me: mattia.sirre@gmail.com
